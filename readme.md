## [KyBook 3 Ebook Reader](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1348198785) localization.

Please, feel free to send a pull request or create an issue if found any typo or mistake in localization.


### How to add new localization

* First, [fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
* Then duplicate **en** folder and rename it to a desired language code.
* Translate a value in the key-value pair. As example, look at first key-value pair *"DEFAULT" = "Default";* for Deutsch, this will be *"DEFAULT" = "Standard";* .
* Do not edit or delete comments /\* ... \*/
* Keep unmodified Names and Trademarks such as KyBook, Tor, etc.
* Do not break a format placeholders like %u, %zd, %@.
* Do not remove the semicolons **;** at the end of line!
* As finished, submit a pull request.

#### And if you are not familiar with such things as forking, pull request, etc then you can send directly to me your localization.
